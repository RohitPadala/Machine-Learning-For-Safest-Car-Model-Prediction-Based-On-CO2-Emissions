# Machine-Learning-For-Safest-Car-Model-Prediction-Based-On-CO2-Emissions
Insights delivered: Random Forest worked the best for both regression prediction of CO2 emissions as well as classification based on safety levels of CO2. Random Forest worked the best more consistently for multiple runs in comparison to other models.

Compact Model cars and Fuel Type X were found by the algorithm to have the least concerning levels of CO2 emissions among all car models and fuel types.

Using the Correlation Heatmap, we managed to remove completely correlated features which boosted computation time and efficiency.

In almost all of the algorithms used, when fuel consumption parameters were solely used for training, the accuraacy only decreased slightly in comparison to when all the input features available were used in training. This indicates that most of the models base their learning of the dataset more heavily on the fuel type and consumption parameters.
